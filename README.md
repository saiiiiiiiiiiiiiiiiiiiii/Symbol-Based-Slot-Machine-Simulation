# Symbol-Based-Slot-Machine-Simulation

Developed a Python-driven slot machine simulation with a 3x3 grid structure. The game dynamically generates random symbol combinations based on predefined symbol frequencies. It allows users to configure bets across multiple paylines, calculates winnings based on symbol alignment, and updates the player's balance in real-time. The system utilizes key Python concepts like list manipulation, loops, and conditional logic to simulate an authentic slot machine experience.
